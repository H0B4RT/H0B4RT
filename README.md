- 👋 Hi, I’m @H0B4RT
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, low poly models, pixel art, and making peoples' days just a little bit brighter.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Lua, Java, C#, C++, C, Godot, and Unity.
- 🌧️ I'm currently not looking to collaborate on any projects as I am making a fan game at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me:
    Discord: h0b4rt,
    Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/id/h0b4rt/,
    Email: h0b4rt@gmail.com,
    Itch.io: https://h0b4rt.itch.io/
- 😄 Pronouns: I prefer they/them but frankly I don't care what pronouns you use for me.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been coding since I was 9 and I have two dogs that are called "Snog" and "Snogger".
